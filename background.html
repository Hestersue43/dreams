<p>Since April 2011, Dreams of Millions, Incorporated is fulfilling its mission as a conduit for achieving the community 
partnership and outreach objectives. Programs that enhance people of with low economic status in Greene county and 
surrounding areas which have been consistently among its extensive compendium of initiatives linking the nonprofit to the
community, including: programs such as Ohio Means, Care Source, Reentry and Second Chance, Goodwill Easter Seal Greater

<p>Dreams of Millions, Incorporated engaged in a project to research the effectiveness of a blended learning approach in 
 teaching employability skills to person with lower economic standards. The blended learning approach uses a combination 
 of teaching styles including group work, peer support,one-to-one counselling and online learning. .</p>

Employability skills can be put in to three categories: 
<ul>
<li>Basic skills: the ability to communicate, think and learn. </li>
<li>Interpersonal skills: positive attitudes and behaviors, responsibility and adaptability. </li>
<li>Teamwork skills: the ability to work with others on a job and achieve results. </li>
</ul>

<p>We design our program plan to focus on developing clients for emerging occupational clusters in the Greene County 
   and the surrounding areas.  We hypothesized that the plans of the majority of the clients might include vocational training, 
   apprenticeships, and/or support with job placement. Based on our caseload and interaction with the clients we have 
   discovered: a number of the clients demonstrates both an aptitude and desire for pursuing career fields.</p>
